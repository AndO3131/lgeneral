- core units can be deployed later???
- transfer prestige?
- strat map icon for deploy window

**** Gameplay

- ingame help screen with all shortcuts and interface explanation
- France with 25/30 turns instead of 13/26 ???

**** Display

- victory hexes are bad to see many units are arround
- edit sometimes broken? (string too long, many blanks)
- add a video mode of 800x480 for Nokia devices

**** AI 

- does not use carpet bombing yet
- whether enemy may attack a truck position must be checked not only
  by getting the plain distance but by computing the required path 
  to allow placement behind a closed front line
- aricrafts out of action do not return to game
- during AI move view is not toggled (can't see airplan damage)
- check bug: paratroops do not attack in crete and south france
- airplanes do not return though out of fuel and in reach
  of an airfield (warsaw)
- trucks cannot pass rivers in bad weather and they don't try to take
  the longer way around
- AI must protect own cities with units
- AI groups: implement execution order (artillery fire, bombers, 
  fighters, ground units, artillery movement)
- loop execution several times to move when a unit which is 
  handled later blocked the destination position
- tweak tactical action scores (are quite good already though)
- AI does not protect airborne units
- AI does not go for U-boots
