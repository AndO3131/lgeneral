LGeneral (Map )Editor
=====================


Installation
------------
The usual 
	./configure
	make
	make install
It tries to find LGeneral on its own. If it fails use --with-lgendir manually.


Getting Started
---------------
Run from terminal with		

	lgeditor <MAPNAME> [<WIDTH> <HEIGHT>]

If map exists (full path!) it tries to load the map and ignores width and
height. If map is not found a new empty map of size width by height is created
and map name is set as map file name.

Example for new map: lgeditor /home/me/tmp/mymap 60 30
Example for loading map: lgeditor /usr/local/share/lgeneral/maps/map01

BEWARE: The latter requires you to be root or mess around with permissions in a
way you don't want to. Better to copy maps to some user directory and edit 
there. When done copy it back to LGeneral's directory (or install LGeneral to 
some own directory like /home/me/tmp/ in the first place).

It should most definitely be run from a terminal. If not, a new map is created
(size 30x30) to be saved in current directory (whatever this is) with file name
newmap. You could type in the wanted file name including path but it is 
bothersome as the GUI is very simple. Also you can change map size only from
command line.


Using it
--------
On the left-hand side you can select terrain class and tile. At the bottom you 
can set the name which is reset to default on changing the class. E.g. to get 
a river, select river, type the river's name and use whatever tiles you need.
The name is kept. If you switch to let's say town the name is reset.

You can left-click on the map or keep left mouse button pressed and move mouse
around to set new tiles. With right click you reset to some random grass tile.
Scrolling can only be done by cursor keys.

SPECIAL BONUS: Set a name and use middle mouse button to only change the name.
Useful to, e.g, rename rivers or bigger towns afterwards. Should work with 
dragging as well but doesn't. Which is a bug (SDL doesn't seem to deliver button
state right).

At the bottom you can set the file name (including the path). No in-word editing
possible, so changing the first character means erasing all the others. Therefore
it is best to start lgeditor in your map directory and use no path at all (to have
it saved in current location).

L loads map, S saves map, Q quits (no prompting). There is no undo. Suggestion:
Start with something like mymap. When a certain portion is done, change name to
mymap1 and save. Like this go up in numbers. You can go back to earlier versions
by changing file name. Copy final product to LGeneral's directory.


That's it for now. Pretty basic so far but it should work.
